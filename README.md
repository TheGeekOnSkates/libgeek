# My personal code library

This has been a long time in coming.  At work, I have a nice collection of reusable functions for every language we use.  At home... I just kinda build stuff cuz it's fun to build stuff.  But I've never actually started a code library of my own... not in a long time, anyway.  The languages I'll be focusing on are:

* **C:** My go-to for "serious fun coding" projects
* **Forth:** My favorite language for shell scripting and random tinkering
* **PHP:** It's the only language I know how to use well for server-side scripting.  I prefer Python but never get to use it, so PHP is an "old reliable" for web stuff
* **JavaScript:** Cuz like it or not, it ain't going anywhere.


# TO-DO's

* In my Forth folder, for each file, say which Forths it works in.  Like Gforth for DOS != Gforth for Android != Pforth, so some of it will break :)
* In my C folder, add some of my VIC-20 macros
* Add db.php to my PHP folder
